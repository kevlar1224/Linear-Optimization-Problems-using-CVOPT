# Linear-Optimization-Problems-using-CVOPT

I made this notebook for an assignment in one of my classes in the UC Davis MSBA program. The assignment was to create a “cheat sheet” for one of the topics we had covered, and I chose to focus on linear optimization, including integer programming. The notebook I created contains the boilerplate code you need to solve linear optimization problems in Python using CVXOPT, and I put a lot of markdown text explaining how to work through the problem in order to design the proper matrices for the optimization functions.

I chose to use CVXOPT because, even though CVXPY can be more intuitive to use, I think the matrix structure that CVXOPT uses helps guide students to think about the dimensions of their linear optimization problems. If you’re learning linear optimization, this notebook can help you not only solve linear optimization problems, but to understand their structure.
